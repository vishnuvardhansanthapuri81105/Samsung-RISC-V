OBSERVING WAVEFORMS IN GTKWAVE FOR RISC-V SIMULATION:

After running the Verilog simulation, the results are saved in a VCD (Value Change Dump) file. This file contains all the signal changes that happened during the simulation. To view these signals as waveforms, we use GTKWave, a tool that helps us analyze and debug our design.

Steps to View Waveforms in GTKWave
1. Run the Simulation

First, make sure you have already run the simulation using:
./iiitb_rv32i

This command generates a file called iiitb_rv32i.vcd, which stores the signal changes.

2. Open GTKWave

To view the waveforms, enter:
gtkwave iiitb_rv32i.vcd

This will open GTKWave and load the saved signal data.


3. Understanding the GTKWave Window

Once GTKWave opens, you will see different sections:
Signals Panel (left side): Lists all the signals from your simulation.
Waveform Viewer (right side): Shows how signals change over time.
Time Scale (top): Represents time steps in the simulation.


4. Adding Signals to the Waveform Viewer


To observe how different signals change:
Find the signals (like pc, instr, or reg_file) in the Signals Panel.
Drag and drop them into the Waveform Viewer or right-click and select Insert into Waveform.


5. Analyzing the Waveforms


Program Counter (pc): Helps track which instruction is being executed.
Instruction Register (instr): Shows which instruction is currently running.
Registers and Data Paths: Help check if the CPU is working correctly.

6. Adjusting the View


Zoom In/Out: Use the zoom buttons to focus on specific time intervals.
Scroll Along Time: Drag left or right to see how values change at different clock cycles.


Why Use GTKWave?
GTKWave helps us visualize whatâ€™s happening inside the CPU step by step. It is useful for debugging and ensuring that the instructions are executed correctly.
